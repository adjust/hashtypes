[![CI](https://github.com/adjust/hashtypes/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adjust/hashtypes/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This extension is actually a fork of shatypes[1] which adds some other data types
as crc32 and provides some fixes to original implementations.

This project is a continuation of the hashtypes project.
Many thanks to Andrey Ropp, Infofarmer, and others for their work and support on the transition.
